For assignment 1 of this homework, I implemented clustering to do exploratory analysis on time series for the number of establishments by NYC zip code between 1994 and 2014. I downloaded the data, cleaned it, and standardized each observation. I used k means clustering to create clusters of zip codes that showed similar time series patterns. I then plotted my clusters over a choropleth of NYC zip codes for a spatial visualization of the clusters. I then implemented hierarchical clustering and plotted a dendrogram and attempted to interpret my results. 

For assignment 2, I worked on finding periodicity in the MTA turnstyle data using the Fourier transform. I used the Fourier transform to transform the MTA data from the time domain to the frequency domain. I plotted a power spectrum for each time series in the frequency domain. I identified the four stations with the most prominent periodic trends based on their power spectrum values. I then plotted swipes against time for these four stations to try to identify what is behind the periodicity. 

I worked on this homework with Ursula Kaczmarek, Nathan Caplan, and Christine Biddlecombe. I contributed for much of assignment 2 in our group.
