## Assignment 1 
For assignment 1, I did some practice with pandas. I found the PLUTO dataset online, downloaded it, unzipped it, and read Manhattan and Brooklyn csv files in to pandas dataframes. I then manipulated the dataframes by dropping columns, renaming columns, mapping values, merging the datasets together, and doing a calculation to do some quick analysis on Land Use types in Manhattan and Brooklyn. 

## Assignment 2
For assignment 2, I did practice with SQL. I ran queries on the CitiBike dataset through the CartoDB API. I ran some queries to get general experience, experience with dates and times, and experience with some spatial data. At the end, I put it all these pieces together. 

I worked on this homework by myself.
