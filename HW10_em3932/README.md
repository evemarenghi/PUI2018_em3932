For assignment 1, I completed the lab that we started in class. I fit a single degree polynomial and a second degree polynomial to the Anscomby 1 and Anscomby 2 distributions. I examined the model summary results and plotted the data and models. I compared the models using the LR ratio test to determine which model was preferable (simple or complex). I then calculated the LR statistic for both distributions and compared to the chi-square table to reject or fail to reject my null hypotheses. 

For assignment 2, I did an analysis to determine if building occupancy can predict energy consumption. I obtained and cleaned the data. I created scatter matrices. I plotted choropleths of the quantities I was interested in. I plotted the data in log scale to make the magnitudes more interpretable. I fit a first degree and second degree polynomial to the data (energy vs. building units). I examined summary results for my models. I calculated and plotted errors. Finally, I calculated chi-square statistics and compared them for my models. Then, I compared linear and curve fits with the likelihood ratio test. 

I worked on this homework by myself. I went to office hours and asked Ilays for help with a few questions I had about calculating the errors and the chi-square function.
