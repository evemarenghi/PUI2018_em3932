This file is a peer review of Eve Marenghi's Citibike assignment in HW4 by Nathan Caplan.

1.The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are, for the most part, formulated correctly. The only thing I noticed was that the less than or equal sign was not in LaTeX format but rather in normal type.

2.The project was looking into whether the proportion to riders, in their 30's, who rode on the weekend compared to the whole week was larger than the proportion to riders, in their 20's, who rode on the weekend compared to the whole week (This is the alternative hypothesis). An alpha of 0.05 was stated. Data was processed by collecting the day of the week a ride ocured from the date column and the information for 20 and 30 year olds was collected from the birthdate column. This was the data that was necessary for this specific hypothesis testing and thus any pre processing that was done was done correctly.

3.The data being used to test the ridership between 20 and 30 year olds over weekends and weekdays is categorical. It is also two pairs of groups of interests, being age groups (20s and 30s) and when rides occur (being the whole week, and weekends). This dichotomous table would then need to have a chi-squared test performed on it to get the proper information about the significance of the results.
