# PUI2018_em3932/HW3_em3932

In Part 1 of this homework, I created a file in my GitHub repo. I then deleted the file and removed all of its history. It's important to know how to do this because in case you accidentally upload data with sensitive information or PII to GitHub, you need to know how to delete the file and remove its history so that it can no longer be accessed. For part 1 of the HW, please reference the file Assignment1.md.

In Part 2 of this homework, I found test data from NYC Open Data, read in the CSV file using Pandas, and mangled it. I used Pandas to play around with the data. I looked at the top and bottom of the file, selected particular columns from the file, and plotted data from the file. This exercise gave me an opportunity to practice using Pandas and manipulating a CSV file in Python. For part 2 of the HW, please reference Assignment2.ipynb.

In Part 3 of this homework, I wrote a Python script to retrieve and report information from the MTA Bus Time for Developers API. This gave me the opportunity to practice accessing an API, reading a JSON file, and manipulating a Python dictionary. I also was able to experiment with writing code that takes line inputs and running Python code from the command line. For part 3 of the HW, please reference show_bus_locations.py.

I did parts 1 and 2 of this homework by myself. I worked on part 3 mostly by myself as well, and I synced with Andrew Hill and Nathan Caplan on some parts of the homework that I was having trouble with. For example, Nathan and Andrew gave me some tips on how to use the URL to access the API. They also helped me with parsing the dictionary to access latitude and longitude for the show_bus_locations.py script. For part 4 of the HW, please reference get_bus_info.py.
