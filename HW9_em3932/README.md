For part 1 of this homework, I reviewed two plots created by my classmates based on the elements of visualization that we discussed in class. I forked my classmate's repos and submitted pull requests to submit my reviews to my classmates. 

For part 2 of this homework, I practiced linear regression using statsmodels. I created a scattor plot, added error bars to my scatterplot, and fit OLS and WLS regression to my plots using the statsmodels package. I discovered the significance of adding a constant term to the independent variable when using stats models for regression. 

For part 3 of this homework, I downloaded data on gun statistics, population, and gdp. I then did exploratory analysis plotting gun statistics against gdp for different countries. I practiced plotting error bars. I used stats models OLS and WLS regression to fit lines to my data. I also used numpy poly fit. I played around with stats models influence plot and seaborn's regression function. 

I did this homework by myself. Nathan Caplan showed me how to make the United States dot a different color in the number of mass shootings against the number of civilian firearms plot.
